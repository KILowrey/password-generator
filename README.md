# password-generator
## 03 JavaScript Assignment

This is a Password generator coded using JavaScript, with HTML and CSS already provided by the class.

This webpage askes for a length the password, then askes what kinds of characters the user needs and doesn't need.

A feature I'm happy with in this project, is that whatever password is generated will always have a minimum of 2 of each character type (beacuse most websites require that) and all the rest of the characters, should more be needed, are random.

While there was planty of looking other people's code, the end result is undeniabliy my own. Snippets were copied, but the overall format is original.

You can look at the Console on your browser to get a better look at what's going on inside ;)
